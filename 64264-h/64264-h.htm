<p>Oh, it was to be so jolly! What a game! Such excitement they hadn't
known in years. The children catapulted this way and that across the
green lawns, shouting at each other, holding hands, flying in circles,
climbing trees, laughing.... Overhead, the rockets flew and beetle-cars
whispered by on the streets, but the children played on. Such fun, such
tremulous joy, such tumbling and hearty screaming.</p>

<p>Mink ran into the house, all dirt and sweat. For her seven years she
was loud and strong and definite. Her mother, Mrs. Morris, hardly saw
her as she yanked out drawers and rattled pans and tools into a large
sack.</p>

<p>"Heavens, Mink, what's going on?"</p>

<p>"The most exciting game ever!" gasped Mink, pink-faced.</p>

<p>"Stop and get your breath," said the mother.</p>

<p>"No, I'm all right," gasped Mink. "Okay I take these things, Mom?"</p>

<p>"But don't dent them," said Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you!" cried Mink and boom! she was gone, like a
rocket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris surveyed the fleeing tot. "What's the name of the game?"</p>

<p>"Invasion!" said Mink. The door slammed.</p>

<p>In every yard on the street children brought out knives and forks and
pokers and old stove pipes and can-openers.</p>

<p>It was an interesting fact that this fury and bustle occurred only
among the younger children. The older ones, those ten years and more
disdained the affair and marched scornfully off on hikes or played a
more dignified version of hide-and-seek on their own.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, parents came and went in chromium beetles. Repair men
came to repair the vacuum elevators in houses, to fix fluttering
television sets or hammer upon stubborn food-delivery tubes. The
adult civilization passed and repassed the busy youngsters, jealous
of the fierce energy of the wild tots, tolerantly amused at their
flourishings, longing to join in themselves.</p>

<p>"This and this and <i>this</i>," said Mink, instructing the others with
their assorted spoons and wrenches. "Do that, and bring <i>that</i> over
here. No! <i>Here</i>, ninnie! Right. Now, get back while I fix this&mdash;"
Tongue in teeth, face wrinkled in thought. "Like that. See?"</p>

<p>"Yayyyy!" shouted the kids.</p>

<p>Twelve-year-old Joseph Connors ran up.</p>

<p>"Go away," said Mink straight at him.</p>

<p>"I wanna play," said Joseph.</p>

<p>"Can't!" said Mink.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You'd just make fun of us."</p>

<p>"Honest, I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"No. We know <i>you</i>. Go away or we'll kick you."</p>

<p>Another twelve-year-old boy whirred by on little motor-skates. "Aye,
Joe! Come on! Let them sissies play!"</p>

<p>Joseph showed reluctance and a certain wistfulness. "I <i>want</i> to play,"
he said.</p>

<p>"You're old," said Mink, firmly.</p>

<p>"Not <i>that</i> old," said Joe sensibly.</p>

<p>"You'd only laugh and spoil the Invasion."</p>

<p>The boy on the motor-skates made a rude lip noise. "Come on, Joe! Them
and their fairies! Nuts!"</p>

<p>Joseph walked off slowly. He kept looking back, all down the block.</p>

<p>Mink was already busy again. She made a kind of apparatus with her
gathered equipment. She had appointed another little girl with a pad
and pencil to take down notes in painful slow scribbles. Their voices
rose and fell in the warm sunlight.</p>

<p>All around them the city hummed. The streets were lined with good
green and peaceful trees. Only the wind made a conflict across the
city, across the country, across the continent. In a thousand other
cities there were trees and children and avenues, business men in their
quiet offices taping their voices, or watching televisors. Rockets
hovered like darning needles in the blue sky. There was the universal,
quiet conceit and easiness of men accustomed to peace, quite certain
there would never be trouble again. Arm in arm, men all over earth
were a united front. The perfect weapons were held in equal trust by
all nations. A situation of incredibly beautiful balance had been
brought about. There were no traitors among men, no unhappy ones, no
disgruntled ones; therefore the world was based upon a stable ground.
Sunlight illumined half the world and the trees drowsed in a tide of
warm air.</p>

<p>Mink's mother, from her upstairs window, gazed down.</p>

<p>The children.</p>

<p>She looked upon them and shook her head. Well, they'd eat well, sleep
well, and be in school on Monday. Bless their vigorous little bodies.
She listened.</p>

<p>Mink talked earnestly to someone near the rose-bush&mdash;though there was
no one there.</p>

<p>These odd children. And the little girl, what was her name? Anna? Anna
took notes on a pad. First, Mink asked the rose-bush a question, then
called the answer to Anna.</p>

<p>"Triangle," said Mink.</p>

<p>"What's a tri," said Anna with difficulty, "angle?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mink.</p>

<p>"How you spell it?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"T-R-I-" spelled Mink, slowly, then snapped, "Oh, spell it yourself!"
She went on to other words. "Beam," she said.</p>

<p>"I haven't got tri," said Anna, "angle down yet!"</p>

<p>"Well, hurry, hurry!" cried Mink.</p>

<p>Mink's mother leaned out the upstairs window. "A-N-G-L-E," she spelled
down at Anna.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, Mrs. Morris," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mink's mother and withdrew, laughing, to dust the
hall with an electro-duster-magnet.</p>

<p>The voices wavered on the shimmery air. "Beam," said Anna. Fading.</p>

<p>"Four-nine-seven-A-and-B-and-X," said Mink, far away, seriously. "And a
fork and a string and a&mdash;hex-hex-agony ... hexagon<i>al</i>!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At lunch, Mink gulped milk at one toss and was at the door. Her mother
slapped the table.</p>

<p>"You sit right back down," commanded Mrs. Morris. "Hot soup in a
minute." She poked a red button on the kitchen butler and ten seconds
later something landed with a bump in the rubber receiver. Mrs. Morris
opened it, took out a can with a pair of aluminum holders, unsealed it
with a flick and poured hot soup into a bowl.</p>

<p>During all this, Mink fidgeted. "Hurry, Mom! This is a matter of life
and death! Aw&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I was the same way at your age. Always life and death. I know."</p>

<p>Mink banged away at the soup.</p>

<p>"Slow down," said Mom.</p>

<p>"Can't," said Mink. "Drill's waiting for me."</p>

<p>"Who's Drill? What a peculiar name," said Mom.</p>

<p>"You don't know him," said Mink.</p>

<p>"A new boy in the neighborhood?" asked Mom.</p>

<p>"He's new all right," said Mink. She started on her second bowl.</p>

<p>"Which one is Drill?" asked Mom.</p>

<p>"He's around," said Mink, evasively. "You'll make fun. Everybody pokes
fun. Gee, darn."</p>

<p>"Is Drill shy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. No. In a way. Gosh, Mom, I got to run if we want to have the
Invasion!"</p>

<p>"Who's invading what?"</p>

<p>"Martians invading Earth&mdash;well, not exactly Martians. They're&mdash;I don't
know. From up." She pointed with her spoon.</p>

<p>"And <i>inside</i>," said Mom, touching Mink's feverish brow.</p>

<p>Mink rebelled. "You're laughing! You'll kill Drill and <i>every</i>body."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to," said Mom. "Drill's a Martian?"</p>

<p>"No. He's&mdash;well&mdash;maybe from Jupiter or Saturn or Venus. Anyway, he's
had a hard time."</p>

<p>"I imagine." Mrs. Morris hid her mouth behind her hand.</p>

<p>"They couldn't figure a way to attack earth."</p>

<p>"We're impregnable," said Mom, in mock-seriousness.</p>

<p>"That's the word Drill used! Impreg&mdash;That was the word, Mom."</p>

<p>"My, my. Drill's a brilliant little boy. Two-bit words."</p>

<p>"They couldn't figure a way to attack, Mom. Drill says&mdash;he says in
order to make a good fight you got to have a new way of surprising
people. That way you win. And he says also you got to have help from
your enemy."</p>

<p>"A fifth column," said Mom.</p>

<p>"Yeah. That's what Drill said. And they couldn't figure a way to
surprise Earth or get help."</p>

<p>"No wonder. We're pretty darn strong," laughed Mom, cleaning up. Mink
sat there, staring at the table, seeing what she was talking about.</p>

<p>"Until, one day," whispered Mink, melodramatically, "they thought of
children!"</p>

<p>"<i>Well!</i>" said Mrs. Morris brightly.</p>

<p>"And they thought of how grown-ups are so busy they never look under
rose-bushes or on lawns!"</p>

<p>"Only for snails and fungus."</p>

<p>"And then there's something about dim-dims."</p>

<p>"Dim-dims?"</p>

<p>"Dimens-shuns."</p>

<p>"Dimensions?"</p>

<p>"Four of 'em! And there's something about kids under nine and
imagination. It's real funny to hear Drill talk."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris was tired. "Well, it must be funny. You're keeping Drill
waiting now. It's getting late in the day and, if you want to have your
Invasion before your supper bath, you'd better jump."</p>

<p>"Do I have to take a bath?" growled Mink.</p>

<p>"You do. Why is it children hate water? No matter what age you live in
children hate water behind the ears!"</p>

<p>"Drill says I won't have to take baths," said Mink.</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, does he?"</p>

<p>"He told all the kids that. No more baths. And we can stay up till ten
o'clock and go to two televisor shows on Saturday 'stead of one!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Drill better mind his p's and q's. I'll call up his mother
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mink went to the door. "We're having trouble with guys like Pete Britz
and Dale Jerrick. They're growing up. They make fun. They're worse than
parents. They just won't believe in Drill. They're so snooty, cause
they're growing up. You'd think they'd know better. They were little
only a coupla years ago. I hate them worst. We'll kill them <i>first</i>."</p>

<p>"Your father and I, last?"</p>

<p>"Drill says you're dangerous. Know why? Cause you don't believe in
Martians! They're going to let <i>us</i> run the world. Well, not just us,
but the kids over in the next block, too. I might be queen." She opened
the door. "Mom?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"What's&mdash;lodge ... ick?"</p>

<p>"Logic? Why, dear, logic is knowing what things are true and not true."</p>

<p>"He <i>mentioned</i> that," said Mink. "And what's im&mdash;pres&mdash;sion&mdash;able?" It
took her a minute to say it.</p>

<p>"Why, it means&mdash;" Her mother looked at the floor, laughing gently. "It
means&mdash;to be a child, dear."</p>

<p>"Thanks for lunch!" Mink ran out, then stuck her head back in. "Mom,
I'll be sure you won't be hurt, much, really!"</p>

<p>"Well, thanks," said Mom.</p>

<p><i>Slam</i> went the door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At four o'clock the audio-visor buzzed. Mrs. Morris flipped the tab.
"Hello, Helen!" she said, in welcome.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mary. How are things in New York?"</p>

<p>"Fine, how are things in Scranton? You look tired."</p>

<p>"So do you. The children. Underfoot," said Helen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris sighed, "My Mink, too. The super Invasion."</p>

<p>Helen laughed. "Are your kids playing that game, too?"</p>

<p>"Lord, yes. Tomorrow it'll be geometrical jacks and motorized
hopscotch. Were we this bad when we were kids in '48?"</p>

<p>"Worse. Japs and Nazis. Don't know how my parents put up with me.
Tomboy."</p>

<p>"Parents learn to shut their ears."</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Mary?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris' eyes were half-closed; her tongue slid slowly,
thoughtfully over her lower lip. "Eh," She jerked. "Oh, nothing. Just
thought about <i>that</i>. Shutting ears and such. Never mind. Where were
we?"</p>

<p>"My boy Tim's got a crush on some guy named&mdash;<i>Drill</i>, I think it was."</p>

<p>"Must be a new password. Mink likes him, too."</p>

<p>"Didn't know it got as far as New York. Word of mouth, I imagine. Looks
like a scrap drive. I talked to Josephine and she said her kids&mdash;that's
in Boston&mdash;are wild on this new game. It's sweeping the country."</p>

<p>At this moment, Mink trotted into the kitchen to gulp a glass of water.
Mrs. Morris turned. "How're things going?"</p>

<p>"Almost finished," said Mink.</p>

<p>"Swell," said Mrs. Morris. "What's <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"A yo-yo," said Mink. "Watch."</p>

<p>She flung the yo-yo down its string. Reaching the end it&mdash;</p>

<p>It vanished.</p>

<p>"See?" said Mink. "Ope!" Dibbling her finger she made the yo-yo
reappear and zip up the string.</p>

<p>"Do that again," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Can't. Zero hour's five o'clock! 'Bye."</p>

<p>Mink exited, zipping her yo-yo.</p>

<p>On the audio-visor, Helen laughed. "Tim brought one of those yo-yo's in
this morning, but when I got curious he said he wouldn't show it to me,
and when I tried to work it, finally, it wouldn't work."</p>

<p>"You're not <i>impressionable</i>," said Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. Something I thought of. Can I help you, Helen?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to get that black-and-white cake recipe&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The hour drowsed by. The day waned. The sun lowered in the peaceful
blue sky. Shadows lengthened on the green lawns. The laughter and
excitement continued. One little girl ran away, crying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris came out the front door.</p>

<p>"Mink, was that Peggy Ann crying?"</p>

<p>Mink was bent over in the yard, near the rose-bush. "Yeah. She's a
scarebaby. We won't let her play, now. She's getting too old to play. I
guess she grew up all of a sudden."</p>

<p>"Is that why she cried? Nonsense. Give me a civil answer, young lady,
or inside you come!"</p>

<p>Mink whirled in consternation, mixed with irritation. "I can't quit
now. It's almost time. I'll be good. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Did you hit Peggy Ann?"</p>

<p>"No, honest. You ask her. It was something&mdash;well, she's just a
scaredy-pants."</p>

<p>The ring of children drew in around Mink where she scowled at her work
with spoons and a kind of square shaped arrangement of hammers and
pipes. "There and there," murmured Mink.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" said Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>"Drill's stuck. Half way. If we could only get him all the way through,
it'll be easier. Then all the others could come through after him."</p>

<p>"Can I help?"</p>

<p>"No'm, thanks. I'll fix it."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll call you for your bath in half an hour. I'm tired of
watching you."</p>

<p>She went in and sat in the electric-relaxing chair, sipping a little
beer from a half-empty glass. The chair massaged her back. Children,
children. Children and love and hate, side by side. Sometimes children
loved you, hated you, all in half a second. Strange children, did they
ever forget or forgive the whippings and the harsh, strict words of
command? She wondered. How can you ever forget or forgive those over
and above you, those tall and silly dictators?</p>

<p>Time passed. A curious, waiting silence came upon the street, deepening.</p>

<p>Five o'clock. A clock sang softly somewhere in the house, in a quiet,
musical voice, "Five o'clock ... five o'clock. Time's a wasting. Five
o'clock," and purred away into silence.</p>

<p>Zero hour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris chuckled in her throat. Zero hour.</p>

<p>A beetle-car hummed into the driveway. Mr. Morris. Mrs. Morris smiled.
Mr. Morris got out of the beetle, locked it and called hello to Mink at
her work. Mink ignored him. He laughed and stood for a moment watching
the children in their business. Then he walked up the front steps.</p>

<p>"Hello, darling."</p>

<p>"Hello, Henry."</p>

<p>She strained forward on the edge of the chair, listening. The children
were silent. Too silent.</p>

<p>He emptied his pipe, refilled it. "Swell day. Makes you glad to be
alive."</p>

<p>Buzz.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Henry.</p>

<p>"I don't know." She got up, suddenly, her eyes widening. She was going
to say something. She stopped it. Ridiculous. Her nerves jumped. "Those
children haven't anything dangerous out there, have they?" she said.</p>

<p>"Nothing but pipes and hammers. Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing electrical?"</p>

<p>"Heck, no," said Henry. "I looked."</p>

<p>She walked to the kitchen. The buzzing continued. "Just the same
you'd better go tell them to quit. It's after five. Tell them&mdash;" Her
eyes widened and narrowed. "Tell them to put off their Invasion until
tomorrow." She laughed, nervously.</p>

<p>The buzzing grew louder.</p>

<p>"What are they up to? I'd better go look, all right."</p>

<p>The explosion!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The house shook with dull sound. There were other explosions in other
yards on other streets.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, Mrs. Morris screamed. "Up this way!" she cried,
senselessly, knowing no sense, no reason. Perhaps she saw something
from the corners of her eyes, perhaps she smelled a new odor or heard
a new noise. There was no time to argue with Henry to convince him.
Let him think her insane. Yes, insane! Shrieking, she ran upstairs. He
ran after her to see what she was up to. "In the attic!" she screamed.
"That's where it is!" It was only a poor excuse to get him in the attic
in time&mdash;oh God, in time!</p>

<p>Another explosion outside. The children screamed with delight, as if at
a great fireworks display.</p>

<p>"It's not in the attic!" cried Henry. "It's outside!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Wheezing, gasping, she fumbled at the attic door. "I'll show
you. Hurry! I'll show you!"</p>

<p>They tumbled into the attic. She slammed the door, locked it, took the
key, threw it into a far, cluttered corner.</p>

<p>She was babbling wild stuff now. It came out of her. All the
subconscious suspicion and fear that had gathered secretly all
afternoon and fermented like a wine in her. All the little revelations
and knowledges and sense that had bothered her all day and which she
had logically and carefully and sensibly rejected and censored. Now it
exploded in her and shook her to bits.</p>

<p>"There, there," she said, sobbing against the door. "We're safe until
tonight. Maybe we can sneak out, maybe we can escape!"</p>

<p>Henry blew up, too, but for another reason. "Are you crazy? Why'd you
throw that key away! Damn it, honey!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'm crazy, if it helps, but stay here with me!"</p>

<p>"I don't know how in hell I <i>can</i> get out!"</p>

<p>"Quiet. They'll hear us. Oh, God, they'll find us soon enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>Below them, Mink's voice. The husband stopped. There was a great
universal humming and sizzling, a screaming and giggling. Downstairs,
the audio-televisor buzzed and buzzed insistently, alarmingly,
violently. <i>Is that Helen calling?</i> thought Mrs. Morris. <i>And is she
calling about what I</i> think <i>she's calling about</i>?</p>

<p>Footsteps came into the house. Heavy footsteps.</p>

<p>"Who's coming in my house?" demanded Henry, angrily. "Who's tramping
around down there?"</p>

<p>Heavy feet. Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty of them. Fifty persons
crowding into the house. The humming. The giggling of the children.
"This way!" cried Mink, below.</p>

<p>"Who's downstairs?" roared Henry. "Who's there!"</p>

<p>"Hush, oh, nonononono!" said his wife, weakly, holding him. "Please, be
quiet. They might go away."</p>

<p>"Mom?" called Mink, "Dad?" A pause. "Where are you?"</p>

<p>Heavy footsteps, heavy, heavy, <i>very</i> HEAVY footsteps came up the
stairs. Mink leading them.</p>

<p>"Mom?" A hesitation. "Dad?" A waiting, a silence.</p>

<p>Humming. Footsteps toward the attic. Mink's first.</p>

<p>They trembled together in silence in the attic, Mr. and Mrs. Morris.
For some reason the electric humming, the queer cold light suddenly
visible under the door crack, the strange odor and the alien sound of
eagerness in Mink's voice, finally got through to Henry Morris, too. He
stood, shivering, in the dark silence, his wife beside him.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
